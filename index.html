            <h3>Library Management System</h3>
            <p>On the same line as an ebook maker is our next idea for a major project for CSE final year. A Library Management System manages all library functions. It helps a user maintain a fresh book database and keep track of books borrowed by readers with the due dates, thus saving time and offering cost-effectiveness. It also moves the traditional library setup to a digital one, increasing an organisationâ€™s overall efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Restaurant Booking Website</h3>
            <p>Among our final year computer science project ideas, the fourth one is a restaurant booking website, which will aid restaurants in processing their online business. This project includes everything from online order management to stocking up inventories, table booking, menu management, bill generation, etc. You can use HTML, CSS, Java, etc., where MySQL database controls backend data for website designs.</p>
